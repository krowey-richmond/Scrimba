// Create two variables, firstName and lastName
let firstName = "Richmond";
let lastName = "Krowey";

// Concatenate the two variables into a third variable called fullName
// Adding a space between first and last name for proper formatting
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

// Log fullName to the console
console.log(fullName); // Output: Richmond Krowey
